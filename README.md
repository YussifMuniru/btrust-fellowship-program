# Building an extremely sophisticated Bitcoin Wallet
  Remember this is a purely for Node.js. Any other environment might not function properly.
  Even browserify.
  
# Running
  To see the solution :
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```
  This will start the server on port localhost:3000.

# Testing
  To run the tests:
  ```bash
  Click on `Parse Transaction Hex` button for the first question.
  ```
  ```bash
  Click on `Evaluate Script` button for the second question.
  ```
  ```bash
  Note: 
  The transaction hex and redeem script are already hardcoded in the index.js file.
  The transaction builder is unstable, so I used the builder from bitcoinjs-lib to save time.
  ```
  This will run the tests and show the results.
